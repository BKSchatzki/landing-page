Or I guess you could just get mad at me. But that's lazy, lol.</em>

        <p>Sign the petition to rehumanize his character. He was a talented musician who was outshone by a genius. Can you honestly tell me there isn't someone you know who codes like a god and makes you feel like a steaming pile of tritones?</p>
